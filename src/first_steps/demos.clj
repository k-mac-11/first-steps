;;There's not much reason to leverage with-open outside of the def invocation
;;here. It's atypical.

;;Note: the invocation of clojure.core/line-seq on the (temporarily opened)
;;reader is lazy. If you don't force the sequence or do something with it before
;;leaving the scope of the with-open body, you'll end up with an empy
;;sequence (since the reader will have closed). The call to clojure.core/set
;;here has to traverse the input (the line-seq), so it ends up actually doing

;;another common idiom using clojure.core/slurp. This will realize the whole

;;parallel processing is desired, the streamining approach of line-seq may be
;;preferred.  split-lines will produce a vector, so it's also eager vs. lazy (

  ;;This is an approach that using a vector for the search fringe instead of a set.
  ;;Since we're already pruning detected words before they go onto the fringe,
  ;;we can ensure all the value are unique.  Then we just use clojure.core/peek and
  ;;clojure.core/pop, to get the last element of the vector, and compute a vector with
  ;;it removed.  You could go from the front of the vector, but that's a tad inefficient
  ;;and requires using clojure.core/subvec.  Alternately, you could swap out the vector
  ;;fringe for a list, and peek/pop will still work, but draw from the front of the list
  ;;as with a stack.
